Before You Begin
<p>Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.</p>

<br>
<p>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.</p>

<br>
<p>Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.</p>

<br>
<p>The app store's every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.</p>
